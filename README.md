# train-of-thought

[Ramaximization](https://ramaximization.ru) hackathon project by team "Свидетели ретротранспозонов"

## Project structure

- `data` contains prepared contest's dataset. xlsx are saved "as is", description is saved to txt file (to view it at github).
- `notebooks` contains .ipynb files - exploratorials and experiments with data (and maybe some plots)

Will be added (these are planned, so they might not be used):
- `models` for ML models
- `weights` for saving weights
- `experiments` - code used to train particular models and save resulting weights to `weights` directory.


## Installation
### Dependencies installation

Currently the code is written in python 3.7, some dependencies are provided at `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run (or re-run) .ipynb-files, which are located at notebooks directory, you'll need to install jupyter notebook.
